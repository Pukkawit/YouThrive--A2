      <section>
        <h2>History of GitHub</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and
          PJ Hyett. It emerged from the need for a platform that simplified
          version control and collaboration for software development projects.
          Originally built using Ruby on Rails, GitHub quickly gained popularity
          among developers due to its intuitive interface, powerful features,
          and social coding capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2012, GitHub reached a significant milestone with over 3 million
          repositories hosted on its platform. The company continued to grow,
          attracting millions of users and becoming the go-to platform for
          hosting open source projects, as well as for collaboration within
          organizations and teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub in 2018 marked a major milestone in
          its history. Despite initial concerns from the developer community,
          Microsoft's commitment to maintaining GitHub as an open platform for
          all developers has been evident. Under Microsoft's stewardship, GitHub
          has continued to innovate and expand its offerings, while remaining
          true to its core principles of openness, collaboration, and community.
